# Visualizer
### Author: Dan Filler 3/2019

Description: A front-end javascript based interactive animation that illustrates several basic computer science algorithms. 
Note: Don't use this as an example of how to write javascript. I've got global variables floating around, functions that take 4-parameters, nothing encapsulated into any kind of class, just pure sloppy functional vanilla javascript.

### HOW TO USE
#### Downloading:
* Click on "clone or download"
* Select "Download Zip"
* Go to downloaded location and unzip folder
* In unzipped folder click through VisualizerMaster -> VisualizerMaster -> Visualizer (Really dumb it downloads that way but w/e)
* Double click on Visualizer.html this should open the page in your default browser
* Play with it

#### Tips:
* Don't use the branching factor above 3 or so with the depth more than 3 or 4. it will likely crash/never finish drawing the tree. You can branch up to 9 with the depth at 2.
* A Branching Factor of 2 can go all the way up to full depth (10) but no other Branching Factor can (smoothly)
* To actually get a good view of what the alogrithms are doing, lower the depth, branching factor, and speed, and increase the node size
